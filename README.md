# c-by-example
Reviewing the book "C By Example" and code examples.

This is the first book I remember actually learning C with.  It was published by QUE College publishing, and I used it in conjunction with my instructor who was a developer by day and taught us C/C++ at night.  It was a great class.  Dave, I hope you wrote great things!
