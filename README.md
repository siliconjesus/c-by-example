# c-by-example
Reviewing the book "C By Example" and code examples.

This is the book if you have a copy or come by one at a used book seller: https://www.amazon.com/Example-Academic-Education-Training-1994-03-04-dp-B01FEPJ6G4/dp/B01FEPJ6G4/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=

This is the first book I remember actually learning C with.  It was published by QUE College publishing, and I used it in conjunction with my instructor who was a developer by day and taught us C/C++ at night.  It was a great class.  Dave, I hope you wrote great things!

Chapter 1 and 2 are omitted as they are background information about how computers work more than code examples.  I'll be working through the book with a modern C compiler (Clang on MacOS)

$ clang --version
Apple clang version 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.3)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin21.4.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin

All of this is purely for entertainment purposes, code examples.  I'll add gist content in-line in the folders to keep everything organized.
